						<p>Ever since my mother showed me her old newspaper clippings from her years as a journalist, I knew I wanted to follow her lead in storytelling. She jokingly warned me that this career path provides little pay, long hours and plenty of stress. But she also assured me that what lacks in those three things is made up in fulfillment.</p>
						<p>I agree with her more and more each day.</p>
						<p>My passion for storytelling kicked off in high school. Student participation for my school’s newspaper dropped to merely four reporters and photographers by the time I became editor-in-chief senior year. Still, I was determined to put out at least one issue. So, while leading that small staff, I also wrote stories, took photos, gathered contributing pieces and stayed nearly two hours after school on InDesign putting together page layouts.</p>
						<p>When the school year ended, we had put together more issues than the previous year’s staff, which was more than double the size.</p>
						<p>My passion for journalism has shaped me into the person I am today, a storyteller who thrives on deadlines, who keeps a journal around her at all times and who finds herself copy editing her friends talking in mid-sentence. (I don’t say it out loud.)</p>
						<p>Today, I’m fortunate to have incorporated storytelling into each job I’ve held. As the YMCA of Muncie’s marketing assistant, I introduced short stories to its Facebook plan and more than tripled the organization’s social media reach per post. As a general assignments reporter at The Star Press — a daily newspaper in Muncie, Ind. — I wrote both features and deadline stories on multiple topics ranging from a booming craft beer scene, to the loss of an important community member and to an army veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder fighting to earn his college degree. Now, as assistant editor to Meridian Health Services’ magazine, I’m back to a leadership role, writing and editing for a publication that reaches more than 40 Indiana counties.</p>
						<p>From a writer’s standpoint, there’s nothing like going through the blood, sweat and tears — mostly from transcribing — and then seeing your words in cleanly published type, knowing they’ll change the way someone goes about the day. It is both a responsibility and a privilege I don’t take lightly.</p>
						<p>No matter what job I land, I’ll always be a storyteller. After all, it’s what brings me fulfillment.</p>
